# 32x8 PROM reader for DRAM Arduino

This is software for a DRAM Arduino to read out 32x8 PROMs such as the AM29S19, 74S288, 82S123, or equivalent.

**Important:** The PROM chip **must** be oriented upside down in the socket relative to the orientation used for DRAM chips, with the notch at the bottom where a DRAM would have the notch at the top.
